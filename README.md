This repo is about `my github pages`. All the Main UI goes here. 
Built to learn about web development and create my own blog.

Currently run on `v1.0.0`

## Planning
- [ ] Move to `beta` at `v.3` using `gatsby.js`

## Versions

### `v.1.0` [Currently]

Built with no library & poor `HTML`, `css`, and `javascript` skills.

### `v.2.0` [Archived]

Built with no library in order to learn `css` and `vanila javascript` better. 
Although it's written on `Typescript` and `Sass` :).

### `v.3.0` [Planning]

Using `gatsby.js` with [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) template
